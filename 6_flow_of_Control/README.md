# Flow of Control

## Definition

`Define` in computer science, `control flow` (or `flow of control`) is the order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls of an imperative program are executed or evaluated.

`I know I know wikipedia is not the best source but i found this definition easy to understand.`

Statements normally execute sequentially:

## Types of Control structure

- `Sequential`: default mode. Sequential execution of code statements (one line after another) -- like following a recipe
- `Selection`: used for decisions, branching -- choosing between 2 or more alternative paths. In C++, these are the types of selection statements:
  - `if`
  - `if/else`
  - `switch`

- `Repetition`: used for looping, i.e. repeating a piece of code multiple times in a row. In C++, there are three types of loops:
  - `while`
  - `do/while`
  - `for`
